Before release:
  -> Test it with:
	- sylpheed
	- outlook express (if available)
	- slrn
	- mozilla
	- knode
	- cone (@deavmi can do so)
  - Set the new version in configure.ac and packages/debian/changelog.

After release:
  - Download the build artifacts from GitHub Actions from the workflow "Build debian packages"
    and upload the files wendzelnntpd_<version>.orig.tar.gz, wendzelnntpd_<version>-1.dsc
    and wendzelnntpd_<version>-1.debian.tar.xz to the repository on https://build.opensuse.org
    so that the Open Build Service builds the Debian packages and repository for the new version.
  - Change the version to a new prerelease version and set a new releasename in configure.ac.
  - Create a new changelog entry in package/debian/changelog by calling `make add_new_version_to_debian_changelog`.
