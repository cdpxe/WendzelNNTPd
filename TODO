To-do List
==========

WendzelNNTPd is still somehow unfinished. First of all, it lacks
several NNTP commands specified in the RFCs. Secondly, some highly
desirable features are missing, such as a support for encrypted
and integrity-checked connections.

Major:
- add TLS support (merge best of the two TLS branches!)
- store unique message ID and message body in the DB (this is available
  only for the experimental postgres setup). 
- enable sync w/ other NNTP servers
- *Hack*:
  a) A gaming bot that constantly reads and replies to NNTP posts in a
     certain newsgroup:
  Add NNTP text adventure gaming engine with simple sample game so that
  ppl can write text adventures that they can play over the network and
  with their Usenet clients; savegames should be postings and each game
  should be some newsgroup. Also this would allow coop txt gaming (i.e.
  multiplayer online txt adv. gaming) :-)))

Minor:
- harden all SQL-related code w.r.t. SQL injections
- Finalize experimental postgres support.
	- Excessive testing of all functionality and debugging.
	- SQL hardening.
	- Update documentation: how to setup PostgreSQL for NNTPd?
- replace hash(salt,username,password) w/ hash(salt,rand(),password).
- unicode support (-> domains with special characters, e.g. ä,ö,ü in "From:")
- documentation: How to delete old postings?
- AUTHINFO SIMPLE
- LAST, NEXT
- NEWGROUPS
- in general: implement more NNTP commands
- add postgres support
- add ldap support
- add PAM support
- make use of strdup() ...
- add a real GNU configure script ;-)
- switch to different user+group id after startup
- remove support for Windows fully from codebase
- check whether this code can be compiled on an old i486 architecture and
  on outdated OS releases, such as SuSE 7 or so.
