To-do List
==========

WendzelNNTPd is still somehow unfinished. First of all, it lacks
several NNTP commands specified in the RFCs. Secondly, some highly
desirable features are missing, such as a support for encrypted
and integrity-checked connections.

Major:
- add TLS support, cf. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4642 (check for newer
  version of this RFC!)
  ==> One needs to implement the CAPABILITIES command first!
- harden MySQL-related code w.r.t. SQL injections

Minor:
- replace hash(salt,username,password) w/ hash(salt,rand(),password).
- unicode support (-> domains with special characters, e.g. ä,ö,ü in "From:")
- documentation: How to delete old postings?
- AUTHINFO SIMPLE
- LAST, NEXT
- NEWGROUPS
- in general: implement more NNTP commands
- add postgres support
- add ldap support
- add PAM support
- make use of strdup() ...
- add a real GNU configure script ;-)
- switch to different user+group id after startup
- remove support for Windows fully from codebase
- check whether this code can be compiled on an old i486 architecture and
  on outdated OS releases, such as SuSE 7 or so.
