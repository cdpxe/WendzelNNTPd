\chapter{Introduction}\index{Introduction}

WendzelNNTPd is a tiny but easy to use Usenet server (NNTP server) for Linux, *nix and BSD. The server is written in C. For security reasons, it is compiled with stack smashing protection by default, if your compiler supports that feature.

\section{Features}

\subsection{License}

WendzelNNTPd uses the GPLv3 license.

\subsection{Database Abstraction Layer}

The server contains a database abstraction layer. Currently supported database systems are SQlite3 and MySQL (and experimental PostgreSQL support). New databases can be easily added.

\subsection{Security}

WendzelNNTPd contains different security features, the most important features are probably Access Control Lists (ACLs) and the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system. ACL and RBAC are described in a own chapter. WendzelNNTPd was probably the first Usenet server with support for RBAC.

Another feature that was introduced by WendzelNNTPd (and later adopted by other servers) are so-called ``invisible newsgroups'': If access control is activated, a user without permission to access the newsgroup will not be able to see the existence of the newsgroup. In case the user knows about the existence of the newsgroup nevertheless, he will not be able to post to or read from the newsgroup.

However, \textbf{please note} that the salting for password hashing is using SHA-256, but with a global user-definable salt that is concatenated with the username and password, rendering it less secure than using unique random hashes per password.

WendzelNNTPd does support TLS v1.0 to v1.3 including STARTTLS!

\subsection{Auto-prevention of double-postings}

In case a user sends a posting that lists the same newsgroup multiple times within one post command's ``Newsgroups:'' header tag, the server will add it only once to that newsgroup to save memory on the server and the time of the readers.

\subsection{IPv6}

WendzelNNTPd supports IPv6. The server can listen on multiple IP addresses as well as multiple ports.

\subsection{Why this is not a perfect Usenet server}

WendzelNNTPd does not implement all NNTP commands, but the (most) important ones. Another problem is that the regular expression library used is not 100\% compatible with the NNTP matching in commands like ``XGTITLE''. Another limitation is that WendzelNNTPd cannot share messages with other NNTP servers.

\section{History}

The project started in 2004 under the name Xyria:cdpNNTPd, as part of the Xyria project that also contained a fast DNS server, called Xyria:DNSd. In 2007, I renamed it to WendzelNNTPd and stopped development of Xyria:DNSd. Version 1.0.0 was released in 2007, version 2.0.0 in 2011. Since then I have primarily fixed reported bugs and added minor features but the software is still maintained and smaller advancements can still be expected. A detailed history can be found in the \emph{HISTORY} file in the tarball. Fortunately, several people contributed to the code and documentation, see \emph{AUTHORS} file.
